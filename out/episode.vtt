Leslie: Well, Kevin, Tesla shareholders just handed Elon Musk a $1 trillion pay deal. I mean, talk about a bonus—my last raise was a free coffee mug with the company logo on it.

00:00:10 --> 00:00:20
Kevin: Yeah, but remember, Leslie, he only gets those hundreds of millions in new shares if he actually hits his targets. It’s not like they’re just tossing them in his lap for showing up in a SpaceX hoodie.

00:00:21 --> 00:00:33
Leslie: Fair point. Still, I feel like if I said, ‘Give me a trillion dollars if I just rewrite the company handbook,’ I’d be laughed out of HR. Musk gets shareholders to vote for it.

00:00:34 --> 00:00:47
Kevin: Maybe you need a better pitch deck—or a few rockets. But speaking of long waits, Grand Theft Auto VI is officially delayed until November 19, 2026. That’s two more years of living in GTA V’s world.

00:00:48 --> 00:01:02
Leslie: Right? By the time GTA VI comes out, my graphics card might be eligible for Social Security. Rockstar says it’s all about the ‘polish,’ but I think they just want us to savor the anticipation—like a fine wine, only with more carjacking.

00:01:03 --> 00:01:15
Kevin: Or maybe they’re just making sure the game actually works on day one, which would be a nice change from recent launches. But let’s switch gears—there’s a Senate vote Friday to move a shutdown-ending deal forward. Political drama, anyone?

00:01:16 --> 00:01:28
Leslie: You know, if Congress ran on GTA logic, they’d just rob a bank to pay the bills. But instead, it’s Democrats versus Republicans, with Dems holding out for a sweeter deal. Classic standoff mode.

00:01:29 --> 00:01:40
Kevin: At least in Washington, nobody respawns after a bad decision. And quick note: for anyone affected by the Dallas Cowboys news today, please be aware it’s a sensitive story about suicide. Take care out there.
